  ## Human / Code evaluations

We have released a new type of evaluations: manual / code evaluations. This new
evaluation type allows users to evaluate their LLM outputs with human feedback or
code-based evaluations, and push the results to Latitude using our SDKs/API.

You can also submit results directly from Latitude's UI.

## New prompt template syntax

We have open sourced the new version of our prompt templating syntax and we've
even given it a new name: [PromptL](https://promptl.ai/). This new syntax
introduces some highly requested features such as support for html/xml tags
without needing to escape them, chain steps with custom contexts, and more.

```mdx
<step as='researchPhase' provider='OpenAI' model='gpt-4'>
  <user>Research key points about {{ topic }} and create an outline.</user>
</step>

<step as='writing' isolated='true' temperature='0.7'>
    <user>
        Using this outline: {{ researchPhase.outline }}
        Write a detailed article.
    </user>
</step>
```

The new syntax will be enabled to all new prompts in Latitude by default starting Monday 25th
November. Since the new syntax is not compatible with the old one, existing
prompts will not get automatically upgraded to the new syntax and users will be
in charge of updating them.

## New parameters section for prompts

We have revamped our parameters section in prompts and introduced some highly
requested features. Users can now choose between inputing parameters manually,
from datasets, or from existing prompt logs. Moreover, any choice they make in
any of these sections gets automatically stored in session so that you don't
lose track of the latest inputs you chose if you ever navigate to another
section and later come back.

## Prompt analytics

We have added some key metrics to the logs section of your prompts. You can now
see at a glance the number of prompt runs, average latency and cost, and more.

## Default provider and models

We have added a new section in the settings page where you can set default
providers and models for your prompts. This allows you to quickly change the
default settings for your prompts without having to go through the prompt
creation flow every time.

## New evaluations playground

We have completely revamped our evaluations to make it super simple to create
new evaluations from scratch. From now on you’ll only need to worry about typing
the goal of your evaluation—as well as any additional instructions that might be
useful.

## Latitude Cookbook

We’ve started work on Latitude’s Cookbook showcasing common use cases with
Latitude’s SDK. Here you can find the first examples.

## Anthropic cache

We have added support for Anthropic’s prompt caching beta feature.

## Rust SDK

Our community member @Dominik Spitzli has implemented a Rust port of Latitude’s SDK!

## Latitude Typescript SDK v1 released

We’ve released the first major version of Latitude’s SDK, v1.0.0, currently in
beta. It adds support for evaluations, pushing logs, JSON API, and more.

## Other improvements

- Dramatically improved performance of the prompt editor on large prompts
- Improved error reporting in the prompt editor
- Long-lived modals no longer close on click-outside or hitting ESC key
- Prompt input parameters are now stored in memory so that you can navigate to
  other sections and come back without losing the latest inputs you used in a
  specific prompt

</Update>

## Upload external logs

Users have long asked us to evaluate their prompts without having to run them
via Latitude’s Gateway. Well, we now support this use case. You can now upload
external logs to Latitude for evaluation so that, even if you run your prompts
outside of Latitude, you can keep tracking their performance. We support
uploading logs to Latitude both [from the
UI](https://docs.latitude.so/guides/logs/upload-logs#upload-logs) and our
[SDK/HTTP
API](https://docs.latitude.so/guides/sdk/javascript-typescript-sdk#pushing-a-log-to-latitude).

## Trigger evaluations from SDK

In cases where AI agents have long running conversations with users users only
want to evaluate the agent’s performance at particular points in time (i.e when
the conversation has finished). You can now trigger evaluations from our [SDK /
HTTP
API](https://docs.latitude.so/guides/sdk/javascript-typescript-sdk#evaluating-conversations),
giving you the tools to trigger evaluations at the precise moment you require
it.

## JSON API

We’ve released the [v2 version of our Gateway API](https://docs.latitude.so/guides/prompt-manager/api-access#api-access), which supports non-streaming responses for the `run` and `chat` endpoints. We've also released the v1 major version of our SDK, which introduces support for the new HTTP API version, as well as the features above described.

## Other improvements

- Improved performance of prompt editor in large prompts
- Added code examples on how to use the SDK to the OSS repository
- Improved and fixed documentation in several places
- Several performance and stability improvements
