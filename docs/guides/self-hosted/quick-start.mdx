# Starting Latitude with Docker Compose

Latitude can be easily deployed in a single machine using Docker Compose, which will set up all required services including the web interface, API gateway, workers, websockets, database, and Redis.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- A copy of the `.env` configuration file

## Configuration

1. First, create your environment configuration by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Configure your `.env` file with your production settings. The following key configurations are available:

- **Database Settings**:

  - `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Database credentials
  - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string

- **Redis Settings**:

  - `QUEUE_PORT` and `QUEUE_HOST`: Redis queue configuration
  - `CACHE_PORT` and `CACHE_HOST`: Redis cache configuration

- **Network Settings**:

  - `APP_DOMAIN`: Your domain (e.g., `latitude.so`)
  - `APP_URL`: Full URL to your application
  - `GATEWAY_HOSTNAME`: API gateway hostname
  - `GATEWAY_SSL`: Enable/disable SSL

- **Email Configuration**:

  - `MAILGUN_EMAIL_DOMAIN`: Email domain for sending emails
  - `FROM_MAILER_EMAIL`: Sender email address
  - `MAILGUN_MAILER_API_KEY`: Mailgun API key (optional)

- **Storage Configuration**:

  - `DRIVE_DISK`: Choose between `local` or `s3` for file storage
  - AWS S3 credentials (if using S3 storage)

- **Optional Features**:
  - Sentry integration for error tracking
  - PostHog for analytics

## Starting the Services

1. Start all services using Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the following services:

- Traefik (reverse proxy) on port 80
- PostgreSQL database on port 5432
- Redis on port 6379
- Web application (accessible via `app.latitude.localhost`)
- API Gateway (accessible via `gateway.latitude.localhost`)
- Background workers
- WebSocket server (accessible via `ws.latitude.localhost`)

## Service URLs

Once running, you can access:

- Main application: `http://app.latitude.localhost`
- API Gateway: `http://gateway.latitude.localhost`
- WebSocket server: `http://ws.latitude.localhost`
- Traefik dashboard: `http://localhost:8090`

## Monitoring

You can monitor the services using standard Docker commands:

```bash
# View service logs
docker compose logs -f [service_name]

# Check service status
docker compose ps

# View resource usage
docker compose top
```

## Important Notes

1. The services use Traefik as a reverse proxy, which automatically handles routing and service discovery.
2. The database data is persisted using a Docker volume mounted at `./docker/pgdata`.
3. For production use, make sure to:

   - Set strong passwords in your `.env` file
   - Configure proper SSL certificates
   - Use appropriate storage configuration (S3 recommended for production)
   - Set up proper monitoring and logging

4. If you're using local file storage, note that it requires additional configuration for multi-container setups, and S3 is recommended for production environments.
5. For production environments, we recommend using a container orchestration tool like Kubernetes and handle env variables in a more robust way.

## Public Docker Images

We provide public Docker images for each service in [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/orgs/latitude-dev/packages).

To use the public images, you can pull them using the following commands:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/latitude-dev/web:latest
```
