## Overview

Latitude stores all the logs generated by your prompts in a database. You can use the logs page to monitor your prompts and evaluate their performance.

## How it works

Every time you run a prompt, from the API or from the UI, a new log is created.

Clicking on a log will display a side panel with the full details of the log.

The log also contains a transcript of the full prompt run and subsequent messages.

## Creating logs for evaluations

You can also create logs for evaluation purposes without actually running the prompt. This is useful when you want to run evaluations on a large number of inputs.

For a detailed guide on running evaluations in batches, refer to the [Running Evaluations](/guides/evaluations/running-evaluations#running-evaluations-in-batch-mode) guide.
