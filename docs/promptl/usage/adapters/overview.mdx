description: Learn how to use PromptL with different LLM providers
---

Although all LLM providers seem to follow the same general chat-like structure, there are some differences in how they are defined. Because of this, PromptL provides different Adapters for each major provider to ensure that your prompts are correctly formatted for the provider you are using.

For now, we support adapters for [OpenAI](/promptl/usage/adapters/openai) and [Anthropic](/promptl/usage/adapters/anthropic), with more coming soon.
