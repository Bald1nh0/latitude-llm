description: Learn how to reference other prompts in PromptL
---

## Overview

You can configure your prompts to reference other prompts in your project. This is really useful when dealing with large projects that have really large or reusable prompts.

## Syntax

To reference another prompt, you can use the `<prompt path="..." />` tag. The `path` attribute should be the path to the prompt you want to reference.

Referenced prompts will not have access to the variables from the parent prompt, but you can pass variables to the referenced prompt using attributes in the tag.

For example:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx main.promptl
<prompt path='policies' assistant_name={{ assistant_name }} />

<user>{{ user_question }}</user>

````

```tsx policies.promptl
You are {{ assistant_name }}, an AI assistant created to help users.

Before answering any questions, make sure to follow these rules and policies:

  - Be respectful to all users.
  - Do not share any personal information.
  - Do not use inappropriate language.
  ...

````

</CodeGroup>

## Setup

Prompt references do not work by default, as PromptL does not know how prompts are structured in your project. To enable prompt references, you need to define a `resolveFn` function in the `render` function.

First, create a function that resolves prompt contents based on the path provided:

```tsx
function getPrompt(path: string) {
  return fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf8')
}
```

To enable relative references, you can also use the second argument as the full path to the current prompt:

```tsx
function getPrompt(relativePath: string, currentPath: string) {
  const fullPath = path.resolve(path.dirname(currentPath), relativePath)
  return fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf8')
}
```

You can use any structure you want to store your prompts. For example, you can have them defined as files in a `prompts` directory, rows in a database, or even in a JSON object.

Then, pass this function to the `render` function:

```tsx
import { render } from '@latitude-data/promptl'

import getPrompt from './getPrompt' // Import the function you created

const { messages, config } = await render({
  prompt: yourMainPrompt,
  resolveFn: getPrompt, // Pass the function to the render function
})
```
